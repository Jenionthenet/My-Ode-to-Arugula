        <img class="arugula" src="images/Arugula.png" alt="Arugula">
        <p>My first known encounter with arugula was when I had it in a pasta dish in a restaruant in <a href="https://www.nycgo.com/">New York City</a>.
            I guess this experience stuck out in my mind because a lettuce was being put in a pasta dish, and my only 
            previous experience with that was with spinach.</p>
        <p>I enjoy eating arugula the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>in salads</li>
            <li>in pasta dishes</li>
            <li>on top of brick oven pizzas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The name of this page is "Designer Salad" because my mother always 
            teases me and calls arugula designer salad whenever I use it in meals.  
            She is a romain salad eater and says that arugula is not sturdy enough. I understand
            where she is coming from, but I stil love me some arugula.
