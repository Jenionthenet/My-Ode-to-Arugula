        <img class="arugula" src="images/Arugula.png" alt="Arugula">
        <p>My first known encounter with  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruca_vesicaria">arugula</a> was when I had it in a pasta dish in a restaruant in New York City.
            I guess this experience stuck out in my mind because what I thought of as a lettuce was being put in a pasta dish, and my only 
            previous experience with a leafy green vegetable in pasta was with spinach.  My second memory was when I was in London.  There I learned that in other countries arugula is known as rocket. On a trip to Italy, I had a pizza with tomatos, 
            capers, buffalo mozzerlla, anchovies, with lots of arugula on top.  I believe that experince was when I became a true arugula fan.</p>
        <p>I enjoy eating arugula the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>in salads</li>
            <li>in pasta dishes</li>
            <li>on top of brick oven pizzas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The name of this page is "Designer Salad" because my mother always 
            teases me and calls arugula designer salad whenever I use it in meals.  
            She is a romain salad eater and says that arugula is not sturdy enough. I understand
            where she is coming from, but I still love me some arugula!
